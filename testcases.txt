Assignment 1: A better malloc() and free()
Group: Toni Au, Edmond Wu

Workload E

STEPS:
1. Malloc() space for 3000 bytes
2. Put 3000 character ‘a’ into an array
3. Print the array
4. Free the array

This test case was relevant because it is the only case in which our malloc() was tested against a non-number.

Average Time: 0.061562

Workload F

STEPS:
Malloc()'d 1 byte pointer to a pointer char 'p'. Immediately free p afterwards.
This test case is significant because it tested our meta-data blocks.
Average Time: 0.056406
